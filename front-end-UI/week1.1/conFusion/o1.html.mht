                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly establish=
ed itself as a culinary icon par excellence in Hong Kong. With its unique b=
rand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patr=
onage from the A-list clientele in Hong Kong.  Featuring four of the best t=
hree-star Michelin chefs in the world, you never know what will arrive on y=
our plate the next time you visit us.</p>
                <p>The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to <em>The F=
rying Pan</em>, a successful chain started by our CEO, Mr. Peter Pan, that =
featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

                <h2>Corporate Leadership</h2>
                <h3>Peter Pan <small>Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h3>
                <p class=3D"d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his =
hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who undertook the arduous journey =
to the shores of America with the intention of giving their children the be=
st future. His mother's wizardy in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dis=
hes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his fi=
rst inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which <em>The Frying Pan<=
/em> became well known. He brings his zeal for fusion cuisines to this rest=
aurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.</p>
                <h3>Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small>Chief Food Officer</sma=
ll></h3>
                <p class=3D"d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is aff=
ectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes from a long established fa=
mily tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm=
 in the Australian outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of foo=
d sources. As he puts it in his own words, <em>Everything that runs, wins, =
and everything that stays, pays!</em></p>
                <h3>Agumbe Tang <small>Chief Taste Officer</small></h3>
                <p class=3D"d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discer=
ning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CTO, personally ensures that every dish t=
hat we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing =
that ensues if their dish does not meet his exacting standards. He lives by=
 his motto, <em>You click only if you survive my lick.</em></p>
                <h3>Alberto Somayya <small>Executive Chef</small></h3>
                <p class=3D"d-none d-sm-block">Award winning three-star Mic=
helin chef with wide International experience having worked closely with wh=
os-who in the culinary world, he specializes in creating mouthwatering Indo=
-Italian fusion experiences. He says, <em>Put together the cuisines from th=
e two craziest cultures, and you get a winning hit! Amma Mia!</em></p>
